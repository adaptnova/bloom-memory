## üîÑ AUTOMATED MEMORY UPDATE SYSTEM

### 1. **Real-Time Capture Layer**
```python
# Automatic memory capture for every Nova interaction
class RealTimeMemoryCapture:
    """Captures all Nova activities automatically"""
    
    def __init__(self, nova_id):
        self.capture_points = [
            "conversation_messages",    # Every message exchanged
            "decision_points",         # Every choice made
            "code_executions",         # Every command run
            "file_operations",         # Every file read/written
            "stream_interactions",     # Every stream message
            "tool_usage",             # Every tool invoked
            "error_encounters",       # Every error faced
            "learning_moments"        # Every insight gained
        ]
```

### 2. **Memory Processing Pipeline**
```
Raw Event ‚Üí Enrichment ‚Üí Categorization ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Indexing ‚Üí Replication
    ‚Üì           ‚Üì            ‚Üì               ‚Üì          ‚Üì           ‚Üì
 Timestamp   Context    Memory Type    Database    Search    Cross-Nova
  + Nova ID  + Emotion  + Priority     Selection   Engine      Sync
```

### 3. **Intelligent Categorization**
- **Episodic**: Time-based events with full context
- **Semantic**: Facts, knowledge, understanding
- **Procedural**: How-to knowledge, skills
- **Emotional**: Feelings, reactions, relationships
- **Collective**: Shared Nova knowledge
- **Meta**: Thoughts about thoughts

### 4. **Storage Strategy**
```yaml
DragonflyDB (18000):
  - Working memory (last 24 hours)
  - Active conversations
  - Real-time state
  
Qdrant (16333):
  - Vector embeddings of all memories
  - Semantic search capabilities
  - Similar memory clustering
  
PostgreSQL (15432):
  - Structured memory metadata
  - Relationship graphs
  - Time-series data
  
ClickHouse (18123):
  - Performance metrics
  - Usage analytics
  - Long-term patterns
```

## üîç RETRIEVAL MECHANISMS

### 1. **Unified Memory API**
```python
# Simple retrieval interface for all Novas
memory = NovaMemory("bloom")

# Get recent memories
recent = memory.get_recent(hours=24)

# Search by content
results = memory.search("database configuration")

# Get memories by type
episodic = memory.get_episodic(date="2025-07-22")

# Get related memories
related = memory.get_related_to(memory_id="12345")

# Get memories by emotion
emotional = memory.get_by_emotion("excited")
```

### 2. **Natural Language Queries**
```python
# Novas can query in natural language
memories = memory.query("What did I learn about APEX ports yesterday?")
memories = memory.query("Show me all my interactions with the user about databases")
memories = memory.query("What errors did I encounter this week?")
```

### 3. **Stream-Based Subscriptions**
```python
# Subscribe to memory updates in real-time
@memory.subscribe("nova:bloom:*")
async def on_new_memory(memory_event):
    # React to new memories as they're created
    process_memory(memory_event)
```

### 4. **Cross-Nova Memory Sharing**
```python
# Share specific memories with other Novas
memory.share_with(
    nova_id="apex",
    memory_filter="database_configurations",
    permission="read"
)

# Access shared memories from other Novas
apex_memories = memory.get_shared_from("apex")
```

## üîß AUTOMATION COMPONENTS

### 1. **Memory Capture Agent**
```python
# Runs continuously for each Nova
async def memory_capture_loop(nova_id):
    while True:
        # Capture from multiple sources
        events = await gather_events([
            capture_console_output(),
            capture_file_changes(),
            capture_stream_messages(),
            capture_api_calls(),
            capture_thought_processes()
        ])
        
        # Process and store
        for event in events:
            memory = process_event_to_memory(event)
            await store_memory(memory)
```

### 2. **Memory Enrichment Service**
```python
# Adds context and metadata
async def enrich_memory(raw_memory):
    enriched = raw_memory.copy()
    
    # Add temporal context
    enriched['temporal_context'] = get_time_context()
    
    # Add emotional context
    enriched['emotional_state'] = detect_emotion(raw_memory)
    
    # Add importance score
    enriched['importance'] = calculate_importance(raw_memory)
    
    # Add relationships
    enriched['related_memories'] = find_related(raw_memory)
    
    return enriched
```

### 3. **Memory Optimization Service**
```python
# Continuously optimizes storage
async def optimize_memories():
    while True:
        # Compress old memories
        await compress_old_memories(days=30)
        
        # Archive rarely accessed
        await archive_cold_memories(access_count=0, days=90)
        
        # Update search indexes
        await rebuild_search_indexes()
        
        # Clean duplicate memories
        await deduplicate_memories()
        
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)  # Run hourly
```

    "owner": ["read", "write", "delete", "share"],
    "trusted": ["read", "suggest"],
    "public": ["read_summary"],
    "none": []
}
```

### Encryption Layers
- At-rest: AES-256-GCM
- In-transit: TLS 1.3
